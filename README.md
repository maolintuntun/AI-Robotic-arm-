Language:Python

Framework: Tensorflow

Simulation Environment: Mujoco


Stage 1
  1. Traditional MDP. Policy based/ Value based research
	2. Dynamic programming
	3. MC Monte-Carlo Method
	
	Falimiliar with the representative concepts. It is better to put it in a grid world, using different method. Bare handed formula.
	
Stage 2
   Getting into DQN.
    Then â†’ DDPG.
